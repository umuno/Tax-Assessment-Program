# Tax-Assessment-Program

In this assignment, you are required to work in a group of 2 (maximum 3) to develop a tax assessment program based on real requirements from HK Inland Revenue Department. You have to demonstrate your program to the lecturer on week 10th lecture ( 27 March ) or tutorial ( 29 March ). In your individual report, you should include the URL to the program code repositories in GitHub. The details of individual report will be posted in due course.

## Overview of the assignment

a. Please visit the HK Government web site on online tax assessment:
  - https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/etax/services/tax_computation.htm
  - You are required to develop a program (in any computer language you prefer) that should exactly reflect the computed tax as calculated online(Choose the option of ‘Under current legislation 2018/19’). The developed system need NOT be web-based.

b. Your program should be included:
  1. Input : husband and wife’s personal income
  2. Output:
    - calculated MPF mandatory contribution based on personal income
    - Salaries Tax to be paid if separate assessment assumed
    - Salaries Tax to be paid if joint assessment assumed
    - recommendation: whether joint assessment should be recommended

c. Your program should have the flexibility of doing automated testing ( that is, program can specify or accept multiple sets of input and produce multiple sets of output for testing result verification ). You may use a test driver program to achieve that.

d. You should adopt the pair programming principles that one programmer reviews and tests the code made by another programmer. The role should be switched whenever appropriate.

e. In order to simply the calculation, you may assume the following items are not required to be entered ( that is, set to ZERO):
  - Outgoings and expenses, self education expenses, approved charitable donation, home loan interest, elderly residential care expenses, Personal disability allowance, No. of any types of dependents, No. of properties

In your calculation, please pay attention to the tax brackets (with different tax rates for different brackets of income ) and the feasibility of joint tax assessment. Refer to the following URL for tax assessment guideline( for the second link, you do not have to study property tax in detail as it can be assumed that there are no property tax)
